# Conciergo
Your personalized goto Concert Concierge.

## Description

Conciergo is designed to be your personal concierge for discovering and planning concert experiences. Motivated by the love for live music and the need to simplify concert outings, Conciergo solves the hassle of planning a concert night. This project enhances the concert-going experience by providing nearby event information and facilitating dining and drinking plans around the venue. Through this, we've learned to integrate various APIs and develop a seamless user experience.
